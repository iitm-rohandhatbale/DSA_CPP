## Abstract Data Type
ADTs are entities that are definitions of data and opertions but do not have implimentation details. i.e. ADTs can be a mathematical model or logic but do not have a fixed implimentation.  
The implimentation might differ based on what programming language is being used to define it.  
e.g., a particular data structure in C can be defined using the concept of _structures_ but the same data structure in C++ or JAVA can be defined by _OOPs_ .
